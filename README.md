# Oh god everything is on fire

## Call for Papers

In this talk we'll start a discussion about the issues surrounding technical disasters. We hope to cover:

1. What a technical disaster looks like
2. Some of the issues around managing that disaster
3. How we respond to that disaster to minimize time to recovery
4. How to set about investigating that issue so as to prevent the recurrence of that, and other issues

We'll talk this topic through with the concrete example of production machinery getting hacked in a significant,
but ultimately harmless way.
